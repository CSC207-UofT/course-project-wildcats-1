This application allows two users to play a game of chess on a device locally, with each user taking turns giving input to the program.
On start-up, the users are prompted with a GUI menu featuring a text input asking the users for their usernames, and a button to attempt to start the game. Once the game’s started, each user’s respective data will be loaded from a database, and a new GUI featuring the gameboard will appear. The users can move the pieces according to the rules defined in each of the subclasses of Piece, and keep taking turns until a Stalemate or a Checkmate is reached, whilst the moves taken will be recorded. Upon the conclusion of the game, the results will be updated in each user’s record, and the users will then have the option of either rematching or exiting the game to the start screen.
